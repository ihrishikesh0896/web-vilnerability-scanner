# web-vilnerability-scanner-using-ip-rotation
 web vulnerability scanner that performs concurrent scanning of multiple URLs for common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and directory traversal.

 For payloads we use a list from other sources to have more attempts to get into the page

 In this code, we use the concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor to create a thread pool and submit each URL for scanning as a separate task. The maximum number of concurrent requests is set with the max_workers variable.

The scan_url function is responsible for performing the vulnerability checks for each URL. It is similar to the previous code example, executing vulnerability detection logic for SQL injection, XSS, and directory traversal.

By using the ThreadPoolExecutor, multiple requests can be sent concurrently, improving the efficiency of the vulnerability scanning process.

Please note that handling concurrency and parallelism requires careful consideration of resource limitations, performance optimization, and potential thread-safety issues. The provided code serves as a basic example, and in a real-world scenario, additional precautions and optimizations should be implemented.
